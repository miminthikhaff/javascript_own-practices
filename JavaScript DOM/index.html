<!-- For example, you can change the text of an element, add new elements, or remove existing ones using JavaScript. -->

<!-- What is DOM Manipulation?
DOM manipulation refers to the process of programmatically modifying the content, structure, or style of a web page's Document Object Model (DOM)
using scripting languages like JavaScript. Developers can add, remove, or modify elements, attributes, and text within the DOM to create dynamic and
interactive web applications. This allows web pages to respond to user interactions, update content dynamically, and provide a more engaging user experience. -->
